"""
In order to create word embeddings, I need data. For this project, I am going to use some straightforward and clean data to help illustrate the concepts.

I took this large amount of text from, you guessed it, an article called "Large amount of text I stole on the Internet to increase my blogâ€™s Google ranking"

(https://thierryjaspart.wordpress.com/2012/02/22/large-amount-of-text-i-stole-on-the-internet-to-increase-my-blogs-google-ranking-2/).

Thank you Thierry Jaspart for the large text.

text = '''Machine learning is the study of computer algorithms that \
improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a \
subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms \
build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as \
training data, in order to make predictions or decisions without \
being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning algorithms \
are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering \
and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop \
conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.'''
